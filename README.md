# Ford GoBike System Data Analysis
## by Emmanuel Kibet.


## Dataset Introduction

> This repository contains the code and data used for analyzing the Ford GoBike System Data. The data includes information about individual bike rides made in a bike-sharing system covering the greater San Francisco Bay area. The analysis was conducted using Python and the following libraries: Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.


## Summary of Findings

> The analysis reveals several interesting findings about the Ford GoBike System Data:

    . The majority of bike-sharing system users are males, and they tend to ride for a longer duration compared to females and the "other" gender.

    . Ride duration and distance are positively correlated, indicating that longer rides cover more distance.

    . Age has no significant correlation with ride duration or distance.

    . Young females under 40 years of age tend to ride for longer durations, while older females over 60 years old use the bike-sharing system less frequently.


## Key Insights for Presentation

> For the presentation, I  will focus on the gender and age differences in ride duration and distance. I will explore the reasons for these differences and discuss how the findings can be used to improve the bike-sharing system's accessibility and user experience. I will also showcase the visualizations used in the analysis, including scatterplots, boxplots, and heatmaps, to illustrate the patterns and correlations in the data.
